# don't forget to add the var to .env file , with key :REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL and the value would be your AMS URL
# by the way your AMS (ANT MEDIA SERVER)'url will not work i don't know why
# just try to update it with this one:'wss://test.antmedia.io:/WebRTCAppEE/websocket' and it will work fine
# this main branch contain the whole system which is complicated! 
# i put a dedicated example  which is react app connected to AMS , that use just two component ,check the master branch to see it and you don't wanna use .env variable because i write the AMS URL IN both component as (hard-coded)
